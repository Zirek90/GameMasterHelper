# GameMasterHelper

Project was created in learning purposes of Angular framework, and potentially useful for people who wish to be Game Masters during RPG sessions.
It is called Game Master Helper as it aims to help RPG Game Master to manage and maintain each session of the story.
Now every person who wants to lead the game, would have all tools in one place. In the beginning before game is started, Game Master can add necessary non-player characters (NPC) to the firebase database. Next, to refresh left list, Game Master may click the 'refresh'button. If all characters which would be used during session are already in database, then just click 'Let's play a game' button.

After that, the final GameMaster board will be shown as:

- timer on the top,

- 6 different kind of dices on the left side,

- filter through the categories of NPC,

- list of NPC below the filter,

- important moments to remember like 'traps' or some particular 'plot twists' in the middle,

- textarea with place for small temporary notes on the right,

- calculator with basic operators below the textarea,

I expect that it will make some game sessions better and easier to maintain. This project will be developing with time.

Things to add in future: After clicking checkbox, task from reminder would be strikethrough.
